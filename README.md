# Weather Analysis Surf Up (Module 9 Challenge)

## Project Overview

We are to collect and anlyse temperature data trends in Oahu and provide them to W. Avy.
W. Avy is interested in opening a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. 'He wants temperature data
for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop
business is sustainable year-round.'

## Data gathering approach

Drawing from our experience with pandas, python, and other concepts, learned in this class, we have created
scripts to use sqlachemy. From the database 'hawaisqlite' provided to us we have extracted the temperature \
data and extracted the data for our analysis.
SQLAlchemy is defined as 'a well-regarded database toolkit and object-relational \
mapper (ORM) implementation written in Python. SQLAlchemy provides a generalized interface for creating and \
executing database-agnostic code without needing to write SQL statements.'

## Analysis

The June historical temperature dataset [Markdown][1] show that the weather was hot in Oahu; it fluctuated between 71 and \
80.0 degrees farenheit. December was not as hot but showed temperature marks between 66.0 and 77.0 degrees. \
The summary data 
q) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? \
a) We found, by other of numerical importance, that the following roles will require immediate consideration as to filling them. They are listed in the following table [Retiring Titles](../Pewlett-Hackard-analysis/data/retiring_titles.csv). A total of 90398 employees would be impacted.

q) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? \
a) Short answer is yes there are. However, we find that the number of employees slated to be mentored is infinitely small considering the number high quality resources slated to retired.

## Conclusion

#### We believe that we have provided enough data to the manager and assist him in his decision. There are quite a number of employees that fall within the retiring data ranges used in this analysis. We would also reiterate a fact that we observed and documented: the number of employees flagged for mentorship seem small
